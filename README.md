<ins>#MY FIRST LANDING PAGE WITH TAILWIND CSS</ins>

<ins>#Special thanks to Mr. Oliver Mensah</ins>
This project was inspired by  traversymedia and Js mastery who are my mentors, I learnt Tailwind because of its 
#INTEGRATED CONTENT
###tailwindcss
###html




#SOME KEY POINTS I NOTED WHEN USING TAILWINDCSS
1. Tailwind "container" class does not automcatically center the content as in bootstrap and you may have to use mx-auto to keep it centered
2. Always use a relative class to keep the content in position
3. Its a better practice to have the breakpoints classes at the end of each line
