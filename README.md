# INTEGRATED CONTENT

## USEFUL LINKS

### SOME KEY POINTS I NOTED WHEN USING TAILWINDCSS
1. Tailwind "container" class does not automcatically center the content as in bootstrap and you may have to use mx-auto to keep it centered
2. Always use a relative class to keep the content in position
3. Its a better practice to have the breakpoints classes at the end of each line
3. All custom CSS are suppoe to be in the input.CSS file
